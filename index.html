    <h1>INTP "The Logician"</h1>

    <div class="strenghtlist"><ul><h2>Strengths</h2>
        <li><h3>Honest and Straightforward</h3> – To know one thing and say another would be terribly disingenuous – <br>Logicians don’t often go around intentionally hurting feelings, but they believe that the truth is the most important factor, and they expect that to be appreciated and reciprocated.</li>
        <li><h3>Great Analysts and Abstract Thinkers</h3> – People with the Logician personality type view the world as <br> a big, complex machine, and recognize that as with any machine, all parts are interrelated. Logicians excel in analyzing these connections, seeing how seemingly unrelated factors tie in with each other in ways that bewilder most other personality types.</li>
        <li><h3>Imaginative and Original</h3> – These connections are the product of an unrelenting imagination – Logicians’ ideas may seem counter-intuitive at a glance, and may never even see the light of day, but they will always prove remarkable innovations.</li>
    </ul></div>
    <div  class="weaknesslist"><ul><h2>Weaknessess</h2>
    <li><h3>Very Private and Withdrawn</h3> – While Logicians’ intellectualism yields many insights into their surroundings, their surroundings are ironically considered an intrusion on their thoughts. This is especially true with people – Logicians are quite shy in social settings. More complicated situations such as parties exacerbate this, but even close friends struggle to get into Logicians’ hearts and minds.</li>
    <li><h3>Absent-minded</h3> – When Logicians’ interest is captured, their absence goes beyond social matters to include the rest of the physical world. Logicians become forgetful, missing even the obvious if it’s unrelated to their current infatuation, and they can even forget their own health, skipping meals and sleep as they muse.</li>
